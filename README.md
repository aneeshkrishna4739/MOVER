# MOVER

This project focuses on the comprehensive data validation and analysis of the MOVER
dataset, a repository capturing hospital visits for surgery patients at the University of
California, Irvine Medical Center. The initial focus is on conducting data validation
procedures to ensure the dataset's reliability. Followed by conducting in-depth exploratory
data analysis to extract meaningful insights and trends, constructing machine learning
models to guide hospitals throughout the patient's treatment journey, from pre-surgery to
post-surgery procedures. Additionally, the project aims to develop models facilitating efficient
hospital resource management, encompassing beds, utilities, and other critical elements.
Addressing these objectives, the project seeks to make a significant contribution to
healthcare optimization by providing insights derived from data analysis and ML models.
